									<p>From a young age IT has been a part of my life. I was born into Generation Z, sometimes quite aptly referred to as iGen. Throughout my life I’ve watched the IT sector grow exponentially and ultimately weave its way into every other industry in the world. This constitutes my interest in IT. IT in all its shapes and forms has made itself an integral part of not only business and enterprise but also peoples’ personal lives. I’m very intrigued by anything that has the ability to affect nearly every person on the planet.</p>

									<p>While studying Chemistry in High School my teacher, Dr Burg, highly encouraged all his students to start teaching themselves how to code. This teacher was the first person to spark my interest in IT. He recognised that in the coming years coding would become a universal language and he wasn’t wrong. I’ve seen stories on the news about coding becoming part of school curriculums at Primary School level.</p>

This was particularly attractive to me having come out of a course majorly taught in lectures. RMIT also not only encourages, but makes compulsory, getting industry experience. In a world where entry level jobs are asking for applicants with proficiency in their desired field this made RMIT incredibly appealing. RMIT is a technical school, known for its strength in technological fields. Considering all of this, the choice was an easy one to make. </p>

									<p>My ideal job is working as a Project Manager for Instagram, specifically in the Instagram Explore department. The following is a link to the advertisement: https://www.instagram.com/about/jobs/req/a1K6A000001CtJUUA0/. Firstly, this job is attractive to me as it is working on a platform I interact with everyday. This will give me a great level of purpose in the position as I know I’m working on something relevant to me. I will also have the personal experience with the app that will give me their user’s perspective.</p>

									<p>Essentially, as the Project Manager I would be overseeing my team and their work on every aspect of Explore within the Instagram app; including design, problem solving and specifically the use of machine learning to develop and enhance Explore. I would be required to consolidate the vision and priorities of Explore, develop and supervise the creation and implementation of new features and analyse data that measures the improvements we’re making.  Other tasks I would be responsible for include: strategizing to achieve goals and communicating often with leadership on my progress and ideas.</p>

								<p>A necessity for this job is being able to work in a team and also with other relevant teams. I am a leader by nature and love to collaborate with others. I get bored when things are static, therefore this position is perfect for me, in that there is problem solving involved and the company has a desire for the team to contribute creatively and technically to grow Explore. This will give me a creative outlet and the ability to be doing something different all the time rather than completing monotonous tasks.</p>

This reflects a strength for working in teams with others. This means I will act with confidence in a team and enjoy collaborating with those in said group with me as I strive for social interaction. The remaining results from the Myers-Briggs test were less definite as I fell in the middle of the other scales. I was measured to be 69% Observant indicating that I’m highly practical and pragmatic.</p>

									<p>Much like my Myers Briggs test results, my Learning Style tests weren’t particularly conclusive.

This shows that not only am I an adaptable and independent person by nature but also in my learning abilities. This will also make me very flexible in a team. I won’t have to look for team members with exactly the same learning style as me because luckily I have a broad range of ways I learn myself.

								<p>The final test I completed was a creativity test from http://www.testmycreativity.com. My creativity score was 57.03/100 which falls below the average of 63.35/100. The test results showed which areas you were stronger and weaker in, in relation to creativity. Though my overall score was low the areas that I am stronger in are apparently complexity and boldness. This means that I am confident to push boundaries and not accept already existing conventions. I’m not scared to share my own opinion even if it’s different from others. I’m also capable of storing and manipulating large amounts of information.</p>

									<p>I’d like to create a set of ear buds, similar to the Apple AirPods that count your steps while still performing their original function, playing music. These ear buds would incorporate Bluetooth technology and pedometer technology. I would also like to improve the functionality of the ear buds by allowing more commands to be made without using the connected device. These ear buds, though still requiring a device to be connected to, would get closer to their own stand-alone technology.</p>

									<p>This is a passion project of mine as I already use a set of the Apple AirPods nearly every day however believe there are a great many improvements that could be made to them. The introduction of wireless head/ear phones to the market was significant in many fields but especially for those who exercise regularly. When you are running or working out in the gym alone the pesky cord of head/ear phones that need to connect to a device to operate hinders people from performing particular exercises and stops impedes certain movement. Bluetooth head/ear phones solved this problem.</p>

									<p>However, many people who use their device to listen to music, podcasts or even their workout also use that device to count their steps and monitor their activity. With Bluetooth eliminating the need to hold onto your device or have it strapped to your body, your device is no longer monitoring those steps or activity. This is why my proposed IT project is to create a pair of head/ear phones that are capable of performing Bluetooth devices while counting steps and monitoring activity.</p>

									<p>As mentioned earlier, this head/ear phone product would include Bluetooth capabilities. Bluetooth transmits data via low power radio waves. Bluetooth technologies communicate on a frequency of 2.45 gigahertz a band that has been allocated internationally to industrial, scientific and medical devices. These capabilities would allow the user to listen to music, podcasts, television shows etc without the need to be connected to their device. The next important feature of the product is the pedometer technology.</p>

									<p>The technology used in a FitBit, another activity tracker on the market, is a 3-axis accelerometer. This technology uses algorithms that look for and measure specific motion patterns. An accelerometer measures acceleration or the rate of change of velocity of an object. Accelerometers are electrodynamic devices that measure static or dynamic forces of acceleration and can measure in 3 different axes. With this product it is essential to have the 3-axis accelerometer.</p>

									<p>Something that will be important with this product is its size. Some of the most popular wireless head/ear phones on the market currently are large. These may be ideal when working in the music industry or when you are stationery however, a smaller more compact head/earphone is more ideal when exercising. The product will need to be light and seamlessly fit and stay within the users ear even when doing strenuous and perhaps high energy exercises.</p>

									<p>The other feature of the current head/ear phones I’d like to improve is their ability to act as a device nearly on their own. Currently to perform tasks, using my Apple AirPods, I must use Siri or go and pick up my connected device. Siri isn’t particularly practical when you are perhaps out of breath or in a noisy place. The product would be greatly enhanced if they could in fact be controlled by touch. This is possible as it is a touch that activates Siri. To develop this functionality, it would be helpful to be able to skip, or change the volume of whatever you are listening to without having to ask Siri. This would also be more efficient.</p>

									<p>This particular product isn’t totally innovative as all of the technologies to build such a device already exist. It is only a matter of combining the different softwares and hardwares to perfect this idea. This means it won’t be difficult to put together. Accelerometers can be bought off the internet as can Bluetooth modules.<br />

									</p>If this project were successful it would it would become a more appealing product on the market as it performs more tasks than those already existing. This would justify spending the money on such a product as most existing products are quite expensive. Those interested in tracking their activity while exercising or performing other tasks (general multi-taskers) would have amore efficient way of doing so.</p>
