									<h2 class="major">Interest in Information Technology</h2>
									<p>From a young age IT has been a part of my life. I was born into Generation Z, sometimes quite aptly referred to as iGen. Throughout my life I’ve watched the IT sector grow exponentially and ultimately weave its way into every other industry in the world. This constitutes my interest in IT. IT in all its shapes and forms has made itself an integral part of not only business and enterprise but also peoples’ personal lives. I’m very intrigued by anything that has the ability to affect nearly every person on the planet. 

										While studying Chemistry in High School my teacher, Dr Burg, highly encouraged all his students to start teaching themselves how to code. This teacher was the first person to spark my interest in IT. He recognised that in the coming years coding would become a universal language and he wasn’t wrong. I’ve seen stories on the news about coding becoming part of school curriculums at Primary School level.
										
										Another reason the IT world interests me is that it is always changing and evolving. There are always new problems to solve within IT or using applications of IT. 
										
										I have very little experience in the field of IT apart from being an avid user of the internet, computers, mobiles, the cloud and the list goes on. 
										
										I chose to study at RMIT originally to get into a more specified degree. As mentioned earlier, I was previously studying the Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne. I was finding this too broad and therefore was struggling with establishing direction and a path for myself. 
										
										From my research, I discovered that RMIT is a very hands on school that teaches practical skills. This was particularly attractive to me having come out of a course majorly taught in lectures. RMIT also not only encourages, but makes compulsory, getting industry experience. In a world where entry level jobs are asking for applicants with proficiency in their desired field this made RMIT incredibly appealing. RMIT is a technical school, known for its strength in technological fields. Considering all of this, the choice was an easy one to make. 
										
										Since starting three weeks ago my expectation of what I’d learn has already changed. Initially, I was prepared to solely coding. However, I’ve since learnt that throughout my course I’ll be taught far more than coding. I’m excited to learn about design processes, research, programming, data bases and how people fit into the equation in all of these areas.

									<h2 class="major">Ideal Job/h2>
									<p>My ideal job is working as a Project Manager for Instagram, specifically in the Instagram Explore department. Firstly, this job is attractive to me as it is working on a platform I interact with everyday. This will give me a great level of purpose in the position as I know I’m working on something relevant to me. I will also have the personal experience with the app that will give me their user’s perspective. Essentially, as the Project Manager I would be overseeing my team and their work on every aspect of Explore within the Instagram app; including design, problem solving and specifically the use of machine learning to develop and enhance Explore. I would be required to consolidate the vision and priorities of Explore, develop and supervise the creation and implementation of new features and analyse data that measures the improvements we’re making.  Other tasks I would be responsible for include: strategizing to achieve goals and communicating often with leadership on my progress and ideas. 

										A necessity for this job is being able to work in a team and also with other relevant teams. I am a leader by nature and love to collaborate with others. I get bored when things are static, therefore this position is perfect for me, in that there is problem solving involved and the company has a desire for the team to contribute creatively and technically to grow Explore. This will give me a creative outlet and the ability to be doing something different all the time rather than completing monotonous tasks. 
										
										This particular position is posted in New York. I’d love to work overseas and luckily am a US citizen so wouldn’t require any visa to do so. As Instagram is an international company, I believe working for the them would allow me the opportunity to travel extensively. 
										
										Instagram is looking for someone with a minimum of six years’ experience as a project manager, specifically on consumer-oriented software products. In addition, the applicant must have a minimum of two years’ experience working with machine learning products. Preferably Instagram want to employ someone with a degree in Computer Science. 
										
										The position requires someone with analytical skills, creativity, communication and organisational skills and who can work in a rapidly evolving space. 
										
										Right now, I lack all three of Instagram’s specified requirements. However, when it comes to the characteristics, they are interested in I am well equipped. I have a great deal of experience in public speaking and am a confident communicator. I am very organised and enjoy planning and documenting such planning. Though I mentioned earlier I am a strong team player, I’m also very independent and adaptable meaning I would be able to cope in a Rapidly evolving space well. 
										
										To obtain this job I will need to start by completing my Bachelor of Technology (Computing Studies) at RMIT. RMIT offers a course called Machine Learning (COSC2673). This course would be a good foundation for a future in the aforementioned job and it complements the degree I’m already studying. RMIT also has a course called Project Management (MANU2123). Similarly to Machine Learning, this course would be beneficial in me reaching my ultimate goal of working as the Project Manager at Instagram. After finishing at University it is unlikely I’d immediately get a job as a Project Manager with no experience. I’d ideally find a job working on consumer-oriented software in a team or working with machine learning software. During this job I would apply myself to hopefully be promoted and become a Project Manager. Pursuing internships within the IT realm would also give me a greater chance of landing a decent graduate job after the completion of my Undergraduate studies.
